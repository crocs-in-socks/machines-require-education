So, bigBrain is a neural network built fromo scratch using numPy and pandas in Python. It is a handwritten digit classifier that is
trained on the MNIST dataset. It even accepts unique inputs given by the user (in the form of 28x28 images stored in the testingImages folder).

In order to run the classifier, make sure the training step is commented out and the desired input file is correctly named and placed in the 
testingImages folder. Currently only one image at a time can be classified.
